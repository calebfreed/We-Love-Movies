## Project for Thinkful: Displaying skills in deploying backend code.

This project showcases my technical skills in building complex servers and accessing data through a database. It demonstrates my ability to perform the following tasks:

- Install and utilize common middleware packages.
- Handle incoming requests through routes.
- Execute tests from the command line.
- Access relevant information through route and query parameters.
- Implement an error handler for non-existent routes.
- Develop an API following RESTful design principles.
- Customize and configure a `knexfile.js` file.
- Establish a database connection using Knex.
- Write database queries to implement CRUD routes in an Express server.
- Retrieve joined and nested data using Knex.
- Create and manage database migrations using Knex's migration tool.
- Deploy the backend server to a cloud service.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: `npm install`.
3. Configure the database connection details in the `knexfile.js` file.
4. Execute the database migrations using Knex: `knex migrate:latest`.
5. Start the server by running the command: `npm start`.

## Testing

To run the tests for this project, use the following command: `npm test`. This will execute the test suite and provide feedback on the functionality and correctness of the implemented features.

## Deployment

The backend server can be deployed to a cloud service of your choice. Ensure that you have the necessary credentials and configuration in place for the deployment process. Once ready, follow the cloud service provider's documentation to deploy the server.
